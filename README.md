 My First Certificate (Entry-Level)

> This certificate marks a very special moment in my journey â€” it was my first-ever certificate in the field of cybersecurity.
At that time, receiving it brought me immense joy and motivation.

While this is an entry-level achievement, it served as a strong foundation and a confidence booster for me to dive deeper into the field.

Since then, I have not focused on collecting more certificates â€” instead, Iâ€™ve committed myself to building practical skills, hands-on experience, and deep technical knowledge.
